/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a public read policy for Tambola games and their called numbers, allowing anyone to read game state and history. Write access is completely disabled in this prototype.
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /tambola_games/{gameId}: Stores Tambola game sessions.
 *  - /tambola_games/{gameId}/called_numbers/{numberId}: Stores numbers called during a specific game.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - Public Read: All `get` and `list` operations are allowed for all users, including unauthenticated users.
 *  - No Writes: All `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations are denied to all users.
 *  - No authorization or ownership checks are performed, as the application currently lacks a concept of user identity or roles beyond anonymous users.
