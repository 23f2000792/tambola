/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces signed-in access to Tambola game data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /tambolaGames/{gameId}: Stores individual Tambola game sessions.
 * - /tambolaGames/{gameId}/called_numbers/{numberId}: Stores the numbers called in each game.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All read and write access requires the user to be signed in (either anonymously or with a custom token).
 * - No specific data validation is performed in this prototype.
