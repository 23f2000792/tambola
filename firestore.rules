/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset allows public read access to Tambola games and their called numbers,
 * but restricts write access (create, update, delete) to authenticated users.
 * It leverages Firebase Authentication's anonymous sign-in feature for user identification.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /tambola_games/{gameId}: Contains documents representing individual Tambola game sessions.
 * - /tambola_games/{gameId}/called_numbers/{numberId}: Subcollection containing the numbers called in each game.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Public read access is granted to both game sessions and called numbers to allow real-time updates
 *   without requiring users to log in.
 * - Write access is restricted to authenticated users only to prevent unauthorized modification of the game state.
 * - No listing restrictions are imposed on authenticated users (isSignedIn).
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * Not applicable. The rules use isSignedIn() which depends on the request auth state. No data denormalization is needed.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 * Not applicable. The data is not separated into public and private collections.
